# Team Growth

## Project Topic: Community and E-Learning

## Motivation

- The project aims to provide an intuitive platform for aspiring African entrpreneurs who are participating in the [**African Impact Challenge**](https://www.africanimpact.ca/the-african-impact-challenge). We aim to provide an interactive platform that will help the community interact and learn from one another, as well as provide E-Learning facilities that will guide these aspirants towards building their ideas.

- Our platform will primarily be used for the pre-incubation and the incubation stages of the [African Impact Challenge](https://www.africanimpact.ca/the-african-impact-challenge).

- This project will significantly help the [African Impact Initiative](https://www.africanimpact.ca) to produce great innovation, helping the community grow and prosper. 

- Team Growth's primary goal is to contribute their skills to create a web-platform that is innovative, scalable, and intuitive. All published code will be peer reviewed, to ensure they meet quality expectations. Throughout the process, Team Growth hopes that all its members will collectively mature to become more experienced software engineers.
