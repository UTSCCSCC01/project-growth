## Sprint 2 Retrospective
---
### What are practices that you should continue during next sprint
- Good branch management (one branch per task)
- Informative commit messages
- 2 reviewers per PR
- Pair programming
### What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint
- Start early, work regularly so that there is enough time at the end for debugging and last minute fixes.
- Tasks for one story should usually be split between team members instead of handled by one member (increases communication)
- More testing should be incorprated (such as unit tests)
- More brainstorming to ensure best UI/UX has been done.
- Conduct testing to ensure the website is free of any bugs.

### What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint
- Stop taking on stories that depend on each other in one sprint - this causes some members to wait for another feature to be completed

### What was your best/worst experience during sprint 1
- Best: Pair programming; lots to learn
- Worst: Last minute fixes
