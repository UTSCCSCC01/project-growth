## Sprint 3.md
---
### Our Goal
- To finish(design, code, testing(slight)) at least 7 user stories from the 20 that were designed in sprint 0.

### User Stories for Sprint 3:
1. E-Learning - Track events by calendar
2. Community/E-learning - Create graphic user interface for all pages
3. E-learning - User dashboard page
4. Community - Notifications for direct messages and Forums
5. Community - Merge video chat and chatroom
6. E-learning - Posting Videos
7. E-learning - Submit modules as a student

### Team Capacity:
- With our success in completing 9 user stories in Sprint 2, we managed to create base functionality for a lot of features which increases efficiency of our website a lot. In Sprint 3, we are more foccused to use base functionality and complete user stories which were dependent on user stories from sprint2. Most features in sprint 3 requires integrity from other base functionality and with end of sprint of 2 we can now successfully complete them. The user stories that are completed are Track events by calendar(1), Create graphic user interface for all pages(2), User dashboard page(3), Notifications for direct messages and Forums(4), Merge video chat and chatroom(5),  Posting Videos(6), Submit modules as a student(7). We are now looking forward to improve functionality and UI experience for rest of the user stories soon as after Sprint 2 helped us to make base for many other user stories functionalities and we are focussing on improving functionality, by working on base from previous user stories and then integrating many functionalities.

### What are practices that you should continue during next sprint
- Making feature branch of feature branch to avoid conflicts in develop
- Merging branches should be done under other team members watch who share files which are responsible for conflict, so that key functionality does not get removed.
- User stories which are connected, feature branch should be created from each other before merging them to develop.
- Availability of other teams member for most of the time which helped to learn and understand errors.
- Spending adequate time on imroving user interface of the website.
- Distribution of new features should be based on previous features.

### What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint
- Learning more about front end technologies to increase UI experience.
- Merging feature based on priorties to avoid repetitive error and conflcits.
- Distrubution of user stories priorties, based on team members availability to complete work.


### What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint
- Stop waiting to merge pull request till the end and merging should be done based on priority to avoid same and repetitive merging problems which causes wastage of time and decrease time for Testing and UI.

### What was your best/worst experience during sprint 2
- Best: Understanding priority of user stories to complete maximum user stories for sprint 2 effectively, so that we can work on UI later.
- Worst: Difference in Time Zone, created slight delay in work as we need to discuss before merging.
