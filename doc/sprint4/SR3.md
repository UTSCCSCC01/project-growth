## Sprint 3 Retrospective
---
### What are practices that you should continue during next sprint
- Good branch management (one branch per task)
- Informative commit messages
- 2 reviewers per PR
- Pair programming
### What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint
- As it is the end of the project and the last sprint, we will keep focusing on testing the project until the final presentation.

### What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint
- As it is the end of the project, we will adopt the good practices on our next project as well.
- Stop taking on stories that depend on each other in one sprint - this causes some members to wait for another feature to be completed.

### What was your best/worst experience during sprint 1
- Best: Pair programming; lots to learn
- Worst: Last minute fixes
