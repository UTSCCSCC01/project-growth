## Sprint 4.md
---
### Our Goal
- To finish(design, code, testing(slight)) at least 8 (User stories and Tasks).

### User Stories for Sprint 4:
1. E-learning - Grade and view statistics of students' performance
2. Make UI changes for Chat Rooms
3. Add notification badge for forums
4. Community - Have multiple channel layers for video chat and chat box
5. Fix Like button bug
6. Delete event for newly created event in calendar
7. Make Dashboard updates after assignment submission
8. New chat for Inbox - bug

### Team Capacity:
- After completing 7 user stories and tasks in Sprint 3, we managed to complete almost all user stories from the 20 user stories that were designed in sprint 0. Therefore, we planned to first complete left over user story, from the 20 user stories designed in sprint0 and they were our highest priority of this sprint. Simultaneously we started working on User Interface for our website, and also worked on integration of features which were completed in sprint3. We then took decided to fix some bugs which were generated in these process or went unnoticed in previous sprint. After completing all 20 user stories that were designed in sprint0, we went on to complete integration and tasks which for which these user stories were a blocker. The user stories and tasks that are completed are Grade and view statistics of students' performance(1), Make UI changes for Chat Rooms(2), Add notification badge for forums(3), Community - Have multiple channel layers for video chat and chat box(4),Fix Like button bug(5),  Delete event for newly created event in calendar(6), Make Dashboard updates after assignment submission(7) and New chat for Inbox - bug(8). 
- We are now continuously testing all features and regurlary fixing bugs. Along with it, we make a significant user stories in this sprint to improve user interface, as there are no blockers for it after completion of all 20 designed user stories. We keep adding neccasary stories and task in this sprint, if we discover some required changes in previous feature or if there is a need to add new feature.


### What are practices that you should continue during next sprint
- New task which are similar to previous completed task, should be allotated to team member who have worked on that previous task.
- Regular meeting to discuss blockers, fix bugs and help other team member to understand your code, whenever they need it.
- Creating new branch from previous feature branch to fix bugs and improve UI.
- UI experience and bug free functionality should be considered seriously before merging to develop, to avoid later unwanted issues.
- Availability of team members who share files with about to merge branch which helped to avoid conflict, so that current feature in develop does not change and previous functionality is restored after every merging.
- A new separte branch for integration of two already present feature branch, in order to avoid damaging current functionality.
- Continue to establish a healthy working environment to maximise efficiency of every team members.



### What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint
- Priority of task, should be taken into consideration and separate deadlines should be made for each task based on thier priority.
- Testing all features properly, in order to avoid bugs so that in following sprint more new functionality could be added.
- User stories with highest priorties, should be alloted to team member based on thier availability for particular sprint.


### What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint
- Sometimes not considering order of priority of task, which causes certain unwanted delays.

### What was your best/worst experience during sprint 2
- Best: Improving UI experience and fixing bug exposed us to software development work cycles.
- Worst: Time Zone and varying availability, causes slight delay in task which effects time for testing.
