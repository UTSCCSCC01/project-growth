# Release Goals

The goal of the project is to create a web application which provides the ability to take and create courses as well as make posts in the giving garden. There are three unique users groups for this application; instructors, students and social initiatives. Instructors are able to create courses, and can help students by donating/supporting them from student postings in the Giving Garden. Students are able to take classes, as well as ask for donations and support by making posts on the Giving Garden. Students can also repay the community by offering help using the skills they learned to instructors and organizations, once again through the Giving Garden. Organizations are able to offer help to students having difficulties by donating/funding through the Giving Garden posts.

Some basic features of the application is referenced in DON-24, DON-1, DON-2, DON-6:
 - Having a landing page when opening the application
 - Being able to sign up and login to an account
 - Being able to view a dashboard consisting all courses currently being taken after login

The feature to take courses is referenced in DON-7, DON-9, and DON-10.
 - The courses will be separated into chapters so the lessons can be organized and have a seamless transition from one to another
 - The students will be able to view the course overview to determine whether or not they are interested in the course
 - The lessons will have pdf files and videos which will contain the course content
