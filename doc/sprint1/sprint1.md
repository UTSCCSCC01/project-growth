## Sprint 1.md
---
### Our Goal
- To finish(design, code, testing(slight)) at least 4 user stories from the 20 that were designed in sprint 0.

### User Stories for Sprint 1:
1. Community - Log in to the system
2. Community - Sign up account
3. Community - Message other users
4. Community - Create and Interact with Threads
5. Community - Sign up for Partner Profile
6. Community - Create and manage Company Profile

### Team Capacity:
- We decided to start off slow, as this was the first sprint and each of the team members needed to get used to the technology and software we were planning to use. So, we decided to complete 4 user stories out of 6 - this decision was made as we progressed through sprint 1. The user stories that are completed are Login(1), Sign up(2), Messaging(3), and create/manage Company Profile(4). We plan to complete the rest of the stories in the upcoming sprints as we are now familiar with the technology and the system.

### What are practices that you should continue during next sprint
- Collaborating with at least one other peer ( pair programming preferred )
- making useful branches ( one branch per task )
- informative commit messages
- Review code and testing

### What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint
- Start early, in order to finish the work faster to give time for testing
- Each story should be assigned to multiple team members to ensure tasks get completed efficiently.
- More testing should be incorporated for the features.

### What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint
- We should stop taking stories that depend on each other in a sprint - this causes some team members to wait for another feature to be completed before they can start.

### What was your best/worst experience during sprint 1
- Best: Pair programming; lots to learn
- Worst: Last minute bugs that needed to be fixed
