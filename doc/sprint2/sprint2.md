## Sprint 2.md
---
### Our Goal
- To finish(design, code, testing(slight)) at least 9 user stories from the 20 that were designed in sprint 0.

### User Stories for Sprint 2:
1. E-Learning - Instructor makes deliverables
2. Community - View profile info and change password,etc
3. Community - Search, navigate and filter Posts
4. Community - Post refinement: create replies, Improve UI, introduce likes
5. E-learning - Student Explore learnings modules
6. E-learning - Host video conference
7. E-learning - Join video conference
8. Community - Add other users to the company and files along with photos
9. Community - Chat Rooms functionality

### Team Capacity:
- With our experience with Sprint 1, we got exposed to certain technologies and now in Sprint 2 we took a step towards to functionality which require a good level of understanding of new technologies. We were succesfull in completing 9 user stories which was exactly what we planned before starting working on Sprint 2, this decision was made as everyone now has a good understanding of technologies and everyone had enough availability to complete thier respective user stories . The user stories that are completed are Instructor makes deliverables(1), View profile info and change password,etc(2), Search, navigate and filter Posts(3), Post refinement: create replies, Improve UI, introduce likes(4), Student Explore learnings modules(5), Host video conference(6), Join video conference(7), Add other users to the company and files along with photos(8) and Chat Rooms functionality(9). We are now looking forward to complete rest of the user stories soon as Sprint 1 helped us improve our understanding and we can now now complete user stories which have more functionality as we have gain confidence and experience now.

### What are practices that you should continue during next sprint
- user stories which are connected, feature branch should be created from each other before merging them to develop
- making useful branches ( one branch per task )
- Merging conflict should be discuused to properly to avoid errors.
- Repeatedly reviewing code and testing functionality

### What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint
- Meeting basic required functionality first so that we can increase functionality later on and work on Website Interface as well.
- Proper distributing of work to members based on thier interest so that each can work on user story for which they are most confident about so that overall work can be completed faster so as to test each features properly with adequate time.
- More testing should be incorporated for the features.

### What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint
- We should stop waiting to merge pull request till the end as it cause a lot of problems, merging should be done in a proper manner so that user stories which cause many conflicts should not be repeatedly merged and when user stories should be merrged wither from highest priority to lowest or lowest to highest

### What was your best/worst experience during sprint 2
- Best: Learnt to cordinate on user storis which are highly associated with each other
- Worst: Order of merging to develop was not effective
