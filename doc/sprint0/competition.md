## How is your product unique and what makes it different from other potential competitors?

Our product is unique in a way that it focusses and emphasis on connecting and providing E-Learning platform to users which are deprived of technology and have limited or almost no resources to access them. The ideology behind our product is different from other E-Learning platforms in the market which neglect the fact that not everyone can easily access such platforms and people which already have limited access to technology found it extremely hard to connect to such platforms, moreover many E-Learning platforms are not feasible and ask for subscription to access knowledge. Contrastingly we aim to provide a platform to enhance end to end experience of our users. We cover a wide range of audience and try to reach everyone, so that our product turns out to be equally beneficial for all to be future entrepreneurs irrespective of who they are. This platform will identify user problem and help them solve their doubts. Aspirants can test their MVP in an effective community, interact with companies, investors, mentors and professionals to grow together as a community. All these will help them to raise fund and build their company to be successful entrepreneurs in future.



## Does your product target any particular users and/or particular scenarios in a most effective way?

Yes

## Who are the particular users and/or particular scenarios?

For our first particular users of interest, we will be targeting Africa continent's aspiring future entrepreneurs especially first time African Entrepreneurs. The corresponding scenario being we aim to contribute in the process of providing access to modern technology and innovations. Promising uses of technology in education will help a wide range of future entrepreneurs which can be students, aspirants, innovators or anyone who has potential to grow but is deprived from technology, proper resources because of cost issue. These students usually do not have access to modern Community and E-Learning platforms, because of which their problems and doubts are not solved and there is no proper end to end experience for them which therefore stop their growth. Therefore, we will be using annual challenge application to target such users. People from different continent are more likely to easily access such platforms as it is easily affordable for them and also they have means to connect to professional, expertise, company's and investors. Our product will help them in the process of being a successful entrepreneurs by solving their problem and build a prosperous future for themselves. 

We aim to provide guided interaction within the community and will bring individual, companies and investors together who earlier suffer to find a place to showcase their potential to rest of the world. They can be more productive and save their time rather that interacting and contacting each other in a cumbersome way, which used to hinder their growth at the first step.

## Why according to you these particular users and/or particular scenarios did not payed a centre-of-attention to potential competitors? What reason would make them focus on these particular users and/or particular scenarios?


One of the main reasons being most of the competitors are owned by different continent like America, Asia and Europe. Even though these platforms are somewhat available to rest of the world but their reach is not that strong and there are no such significant steps taken by them which make such platforms accessible to more people, especially who are deprived from technology and don't have proper resources to clear their doubts and solve their problems. As a result of this weak link between competitors and particular users, gap between technology and such user is not slowing down at fast rate. Also, most of the companies are more focused in their own country development rather than development of whole world, and somewhat follow money minded ideology and ignore the fact that not everyone can afford such platforms. In this way continents like Africa cannot access such platform easily and confidence of future entrepreneurs is obstructed.

If competitors realize the importance of growing world together as one unit rather than just focussing on people of some specific regions. They need to realize resources need to be delivered in a more better way to places where already they have limited access to technology. More information and resources should be provided to improve their overall quality of learning. Also competitors who offer paid knowledge should pay special attention to people who are deprived of resources and funding.
