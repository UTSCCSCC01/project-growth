## Reflect on how your team worked together.
- We scheduled our group meetings as soon as the Sprint 0 handout was posted. We made sure to have 2 meetings scheduled per week, making it easy for team members situated in different time zones to attend. At the start of every meeting, ensured we were all on the same page by recapping events from previous meeting as well as progress on Sprint 0 since the last meeting. Communicated specific details and tasks to be completed to each member of the team so they could be completed before the set deadlines.

## How did you organize the team? Which tools did you use, if any?
- Our primary method to contact is Discord, where team members posted doubts or questions regarding any tasks they were stuck in. Each team member is free to discuss it in the weekly meeting as well if the question requries more discussion. We also used Piazza regarding doubts which TA's or the professor could answer better. 
- **Roles were divided as follows:**
- Ronish: UI/UX Design, process.md, PB.md, README.md
- Jai: Personas, team-contract.pdf, PB.md
- Ethan: Personas, summary.md, PB.md, team-contract.pdf
- Shashwat: UI/UX Design, process.md, README.md, PB.md
- Yihang: done.md, competition.md, PB.md
- Naman: competition.md, Personas, PB.md, done.md
- Pritish: summary.md, PB.md, Personas, team.md

## How did you make decisions?
- We used to have a vote on decisions that had more than one opinion. The minority always understood the point of view of the majority and worked on the tasks willingly and happily.

## How did you define priority and/or points of user stories? How many rounds of voting (on average) did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate?
- The project handout had a very detailed description of what was asked from us. Also, Lecture 2 gave a lot more insight on the expectations of the project. Through this, we took a decision based on the information we gathered. Usually we went through 3 rounds of voting to decide the consensus for the point estimate. 

## How frequently did you meet?
- We had 2 meetings per week (Thursday and Saturday) in order to come up with a good plan on tasks for Sprint 0.

## What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?
- Our primary goal is to make our project stand out. In order to achieve this goal, we learned that it is extremely essential to discuss with your team members, ask questions, in order to come up with new and interesting ideas. The more we discuss, the more ideas are given space to grow, making our project "different" from the rest. For the next phase, we will make sure to have meetings a bit more spread out, or even have just one long meeting, giving the team members enough time to complete their tasks.
