## Project Objectives 
 Create a all-in-one and cross-platform community and e-learning application for #theAfricanImpactChallenge participants. The application will provide business founders with easy connections with investors, service providers and corporations, and enable organic and guided interaction within the community. The platform will also feature access to e-learning materials uploaded by community members, which includes pre-recorded audio/video contents, course deliverables (quizzes, assignments...) and live sessions.
