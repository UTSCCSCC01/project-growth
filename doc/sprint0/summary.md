## Project Objectives 
 Create an all-in-one and cross-platform community and e-learning application for [The African Impact Challenge](https://www.africanimpact.ca) participants. The application will provide business founders with easy connections with investors, service providers and corporations, and enable organic and guided interaction within the community. The platform will also feature access to e-learning materials uploaded by community members, which includes pre-recorded audio/video contents, course deliverables (quizzes, assignments...) and live conferencing sessions. 
## Key Users
